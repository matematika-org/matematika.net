# Matematika

<br/>

### Hello, \${userName}!

My name is Marley (nickname) and I am website administrator.
I am from Russia and english is not my native language. (You can help me to correct my english grammar mistakes). Matematika on russian language mean mathematics in english.

If you planning to study DataScience, BigData, BlockChain, IoT, matchematic, statistic ... etc., I hope this website can help you (In the future). You can join to our telegram discussing group and share your experience and interesting samples (no piracy). And i will add materials on website. Or you can do it by yourself if you have development skills (knowlege how to work with github).

<br/>

For now I'm study materials about hyperledger from video course [Rajeev Sakhuja] Mastering Hyperledger Chaincode Development using GoLang [ENG, 2019, Latest updates 16/06/2020].

If you will interesting in hyperledger, I do not recommend watch materials about hyperledger composer and hyperledger fabril with version less than 2.1

<br/>

Our main website is on <a href="//matematika.org">russian language</a>. If you know russian, you can join our russian community group.

### Mathematics for Machine Learning

"We wrote a book on Mathematics for Machine Learning that motivates people to learn mathematical concepts. The book is not intended to cover advanced machine learning techniques because there are already plenty of books doing this. Instead, we aim to provide the necessary mathematical skills to read those other books."

## Recomendation for beginning

### [Paul J. Deitel] Python Fundamentals [ENG, 2019]

https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/python-fundamentals/9780135917411/

Here is course from 5 parts.
Can be interesting as starting point. Here is material about ML, BigData etc. But course is boring.

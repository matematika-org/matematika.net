### Mathematics for Machine Learning

"We wrote a book on Mathematics for Machine Learning that motivates people to learn mathematical concepts. The book is not intended to cover advanced machine learning techniques because there are already plenty of books doing this. Instead, we aim to provide the necessary mathematical skills to read those other books."

## Recomendation for beginning

### [Paul J. Deitel] Python Fundamentals [ENG, 2019]

https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/python-fundamentals/9780135917411/

Here is course from 5 parts.
Can be interesting as starting point. Here is material about ML, BigData etc. But course is boring.
